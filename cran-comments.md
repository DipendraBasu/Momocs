## Test environments
* local OS X 10.13.2 install, R 3.4.4
* ubuntu x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (on travis-ci), R 3.4.4
* win-builder (devtools::release) 

The latter reports some example long to run. I'm on it, and it will be fixed on further versions. I'm rewriting large parts of this package and 3-4 others that will use the same philosophy/API.
