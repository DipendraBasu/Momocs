Description: The goal of Momocs is to provide a complete, convenient, 
       reproducible and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics.
       It includes most common 2D morphometrics approaches on outlines, open outlines, configurations of landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data preparation, manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar throughout.
       It allows reproducible, complex morphometric analyses and other morphometrics approaches should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
